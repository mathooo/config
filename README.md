# config
Repository for storing own config files.

  * .HotShut.sh -> script for Hotspot & automatic computer shutdown after device is disconected
  * bash.bashrc -> main bash config file (in home directory)
  * installSoftware.sh -> installing all needed software

Moreover, from Linux Mint 18 (Sarah), file __.bashrc__ has to me placed to home directory to allow custom prompt.
