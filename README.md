# config
Repository for storing own config files (dedicated to Linux Mint).

  * .HotShut.sh -> script for HotSpot & automatic computer shutdown after a particular device is disconected
  * bash.bashrc -> main bash config file (in home directory)
  * installSoftware.sh -> install all needed software

Moreover, from Linux Mint 18 (Sarah), file __.bashrc__ has to be placed to home directory to allow custom prompt.
